# Bike Sharing Analysis
## Purpose of Project
* The purpose of this analysis was to use data from the Citi Bike Sharing program in New York City, to determine whether or not this program would be a good fit in a different city.
* Below I used Tableu to create visualizations of the data for the stakeholders.
